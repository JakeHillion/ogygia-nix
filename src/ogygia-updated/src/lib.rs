//! Pull-based NixOS auto-updater.
//!
//! Tracks a branch of the NixOS configuration repository and updates the
//! local system to its tip: the running and next-boot systems' build
//! revisions (embedded by `ogygia.versions`) gate the update so hosts
//! deliberately running unmerged builds are left alone, the new system is
//! built from a private clone, and activation mirrors nixos-rebuild
//! (`test`/`switch`/`boot` plus a delayed reboot on kernel changes).
//!
//! The `ogygia-updated` daemon owns all update state and runs cycles on
//! an interval; `ogygia update` asks it to run a cycle now over its
//! control socket.
